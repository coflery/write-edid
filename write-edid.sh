# Writes EDID information over a given I2C-Bus to a monitor.
# Use: 1. write-edid.sh <bus> <data>
#      2. write-edid.sh <bus>
# The second variant expects data on stdin.
#
# You can find out the bus number with ic2detect -l. Address 0x50
# should be available as the EDID data goes there.
#
# This script expects ascii information representing chunks of hex data
# as input. The bytewise presented data should be separated by spaces
# and/or line breaks. For instance, this is the digital (!) EDID data
# for a Samsung SyncMaster T220 monitor:
